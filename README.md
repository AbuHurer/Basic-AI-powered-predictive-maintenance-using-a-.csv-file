# AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

## Problem Statement

Industrial equipment failures lead to costly downtime and repairs. Predictive maintenance uses historical sensor and performance data to anticipate required service, minimizing unplanned outages.

## Project Goal

Develop an ML model to predict whether maintenance will be needed for each of the next 7 days, based on recent sensor data (input: CSV file).

## Key Features

- **Input:** CSV file containing equipment sensor/time series data (temperature, pressure, vibration, etc.).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, imputing null values, feature engineering (rolling statistics, lag features).
- **Model:** Train machine learning/time series models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) to forecast maintenance needs.
- **Output:** For each equipment, predict “maintenance required” or “no maintenance” for the next 7 days.
- **Visualization:** Present prediction trends and probability/confidence scores.
- **Deployment (Optional):** REST API or interactive dashboard for business users.


## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Load Data:** Read the CSV file and perform exploratory data analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize features, create time-based features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Build predictive features (moving averages, thresholds, anomalies).
4. **Model Selection:** Compare ML and time series models.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score for maintenance prediction.
6. **Forecasting:** Output a 7-day maintenance forecast per equipment unit.
7. **Visualization:** Plot prediction confidence/trends for maintenance teams.
8. **(Optional) Deployment:** Implement a REST API or Streamlit dashboard for real-time prediction.

## Resume Impact

- Led the design and deployment of an AI/ML system predicting maintenance needs (7 days ahead) for industrial equipment based on real sensor data.
- Demonstrated expertise in time series forecasting, model evaluation, and actionable business-oriented ML solutions.
- Delivered project code, outputs, and (optionally) an interactive web app/dashboard.
